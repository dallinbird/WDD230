      <h1>Site Plan: Lewiston Chamber of Commerce</h1>
      <p>Site Name: Lewiston Chamber of Commerce</p>
      <p>
        I chose this name because I feel that having a more intricate name would
        detract from the purpose of the organization. A simple name like this
        gets to the main point of what the organization is, helps users
        understand who it is for, and makes it easier for members to direct
        potential members to the site.
